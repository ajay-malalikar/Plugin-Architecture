# Plugin-Architecture

•	Modelled and programmed a POC to demonstrate the quick setup of the web application that could be hosted on cloud as well on in-house server using plug-in framework, where the plugins will not have interdependency between each other.
•	Also supported pay as you use model and multitenant platform.
